lNTRODUCTlON.

§L Tun volume now published contains such centenos
of the works written by the Venerahle Beda as ¹¹''”⁰¹”¹'¹⁰'
relate to English history, together with an Appen-

dix of documents too intimately connected with

the literary labours of that author to be omitted

in a collection like the present. The contente are

as follows:

§2 The Metl'lcal Life ,Of St· cuthbert, Which 'l'bernetricrl
is referred to by Beda himself both in the list of tillidi:
his writings affixed to his Historia Ecclesiastica,
and in the prose life of the same individual, which
he wrote at a subsequent period. No doubt can,
therefore, be entertained as to its authenticity.
Shortly after its composition, and before it had
come into general circulation, a certain presbyter
named John, in whose welfare the author appears
to have felt considerable interest, being about to
visit Rome,¹ Beda inscribed the poem to his friend;
partly, as he himself tells us, in token of his good
wishes and partly that the traveller might derive
profit and consolation from the company of the
Saint. The preface, short as itis, gives a lively
and agreeable picture of the mind of its author,
and has all the characteristics of a private letter.

§S The text here given is founded upon the
following MSS.

Η. The Harleian MS. 526, a manuscript of
the ninth century, written without much eleganoe,

¹ Probably upon some ol those pope which hed now become so
ecclesiastical missione to the frequent.
