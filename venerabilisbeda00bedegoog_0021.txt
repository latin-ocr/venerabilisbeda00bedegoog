MS. 3020, written apparently in the ninth cen-
tury.

ᾖ 14. The sermon upon the nativity of St. Bene-
diet, with which the volume concludeS, is the un-
doubted production of Beda, and is not, as stated
in p. 335, os doubtful authenticity. It forms part
of Beda’s Homily ¹⁰ upon that Saint; and although
furnishing little additional information tn what he
had already written, is here inserted in order to
complete the series of his historieal writings eon·
nected with the history of England.
