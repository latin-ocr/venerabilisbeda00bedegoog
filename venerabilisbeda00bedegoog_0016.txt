apparently determined to remove all doubt as to
the truth of the facts which he records, has detailed

the unpuhlished work was submitted as well to
the inspection of one who had attended Cuthbert
during his last illness, as of others equally well in-
formed respecting the deceased Saint, and correc-
tions were made according to their suggestions.
A fair copy of the Legend was then sent to Lindis-
farne, and during two days underwent a rigid
scrutiny by the oldest and most judicious brethren
of that monastery. When it had obtained their
final sanction, and had been augmented by the
insertion of certain additions for which they were
the vouchers, the work was declared to be worthy
of circulation, and was accordingly handed over
to the transcribers.
